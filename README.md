Mid-November 2024, I decided to start over with my Mac setup.

The goal was to be a bit more minimalistic and a lot more reproducible. ðŸ˜„

This setup will likely not be usable by anyone else, especially if you are not using a Mac.

Prerequisites:
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Manually installed apps:
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

Setup:
- Install Homebrew
- Run `ruby install.rb` (assumes there is a Ruby installation)
